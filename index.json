In most cases, perfect enforcement is not a viable option, and some non-compliance with regulations occurs. We consider two types of violations; violations of technological regulations and quota regulations. We investigate how intrinsic motivation to comply with these two types of regulations affect firm behavior and environmental markets. We develop a theoretical model of an agent facing these two types of regulations, a technological standard and a quota, which the agent can violate at the risk of being fined. We show that agents are more willing to buy quotas if they have a stronger motivation to comply with quota regulations or a weaker motivation to comply with technological regulation. We test these predictions using survey data on Norwegian fishers combined with data from several incentivized economic experiments. The empirical analysis supports the findings. Our results imply that the interaction of compliance attitudes and quota markets affect the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental regulation. This has important implications for environmental markets.","tags":["Environmental regulations","Compliance","Quota markets"],"title":"Compliance, environmental regulation, and quota markets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Keita Abe","Linda Nøstbakken","Mads Fjeld Wold"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673740800,"objectID":"50797baa2a34826e6cda9b9fd8b454bc","permalink":"https://lnostbakken.github.io/publication/abe-nostbakken-wold-wp/","publishdate":"2023-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abe-nostbakken-wold-wp/","section":"publication","summary":"Balancing the trade-off between economic efficiency and social objectives has been a challenge for fisheries managers under rights-based management. While the actual prioritization should be guided by social preferences, the mechanisms and consequences of the quota transfer system need to be well understood.  We investigate the effects of several quota transfer schemes implemented in the Norwegian coastal cod fishery during the 2000s. This is a small-scale fishery that has traditionally been important for employment in the northern part of Norway.  Using vessel-level quota registry data, we estimate the effect of quota-trading and changes in quota distribution on vessel exit using a difference-in-differences approach that exploits variation in implementation timing between regulatory groups. In addition, we describe the outcome of quota consolidation with descriptive statistics.  Our results confirm that quota trade triggers exitｓ of vessels from the fishery. In addition, we quantify the consolidation in terms of catch per vessel and geographic distribution of quotas and landings. While the policy change has the expected effects in the short run, our results suggest that the implications of consolidation last longer.  This has implications for policymakers trying to balance economic efficiency and social objectives of rational fishery management.","tags":["Rights-based management","Efficiency","Equity","Fisheries management"],"title":"Quota consolidation in Norwegian coastal fisheries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Diekert","Yuanhao Li","Linda Nøstbakken","Andries Richter"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686088156,"objectID":"deac66a19edd5a15801f9fab06a784e0","permalink":"https://lnostbakken.github.io/publication/diekert-why-2023/","publishdate":"2023-06-06T21:49:16.145489Z","relpermalink":"/publication/diekert-why-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Why do fishermen comply with regulations?

This article examines potential market failures within the fisheries sector that may arise because of a failure to account for key features of wild-caught fisheries and that can be addressed by an expanded scope. These market failures include multiple species caught together, multiple fisheries targeting the same stock, and other ecological and socioeconomic interconnections within ecosystems. We also examine market failures that may arise when external factors such as climate change and species invasions are not considered in fisheries management policy or if policies do not consider multisector use of seascapes, linkages between water pollution and fisheries, and market failures that cut across fisheries and nonfishery sectors and involve the underprovision of publicly available data and a lack of information sharing along the supply chain. We find that policies that address these market failures typically have distributional effects; that is, there will be winners and losers, even if aggregate efficiency increases. We conclude that research and policy design need to explicitly consider equity-efficiency trade-offs when seeking to address market failures, and we propose policy and research priorities that support the sustainability of wild-caught seafood.","tags":["Fisheries","Catch shares","Ecosystem-based management","Market failures"],"title":"The future of wild-caught fisheries: Expanding the scope of management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Branko Bošković","Linda Nøstbakken"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651708800,"objectID":"0aca8c00a4d41fe9145ee1db8eebeac9","permalink":"https://lnostbakken.github.io/publication/boskovic-nostbakken-wp/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boskovic-nostbakken-wp/","section":"publication","summary":"Environmental policies vary across space, and a growing body of empirical research compares land prices across administrative boundaries to estimate the causal effects of local policies.

We propose a way to separately identify the effect of local policy and the market's beliefs that boundaries may change, and we apply this approach to Canadian land prices and wildlife protection zones in Alberta.

Compliance in turn relies on the perceived legitimacy of the existing rules and regulations, the effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement, and on the positive feedback loop between legitimacy and effectiveness. Against the backdrop of increasing incentives to violate rules and regulations in modern fisheries, there are concerns that traditional control activities relying on physical inspections, are no longer effective in safeguarding sustainability. Modern control activities, which make use of new technologies, such as camera surveillance on vessels, remote monitoring (drones, planes, satellites) and real-time monitoring of catches with automated data recording, may offer a promising alternative to enforcement officers conducting physical inspections. This paper presents evidence from a large-scale survey among Norwegian fishers, investigating (i) attitudes towards traditional and modern control activities, and (ii) how expectations about and experiences of physical inspections affect compliance behavior. We also investigate the role of individual factors on compliance, such as risk aversion, which we measure with an economic experiment. While we cannot document an effect of risk aversion on compliance behavior, we find that having experienced more controls in the past and perceiving the likelihood of future control as higher, significantly reduce rule violations. We also find that survey respondents appreciate traditional enforcement measures, while they have mixed attitudes towards modern control activities.","tags":["Fisheries","Monitoring and enforcement","Compliance","Fisher behavior","Preferences","Survey","Economic experiment"],"title":"Control activities and compliance behavior - Survey evidence from Norway","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Costello","Ling Cao","Stefan Gelcich","Miguel A.

Land-based expansion is possible but may exacerbate climate change and biodiversity loss, and compromise the delivery of other ecosystem services. As food from the sea represents only 17% of the current production of edible meat, we ask how much food we can expect the ocean to sustainably produce by 2050. Here we examine the main food-producing sectors in the ocean—wild fisheries, finfish mariculture and bivalve mariculture—to estimate ‘sustainable supply curves’ that account for ecological, economic, regulatory and technological constraints. We overlay these supply curves with demand scenarios to estimate future seafood production. We find that under our estimated demand shifts and supply scenarios (which account for policy reform and technology improvements), edible food from the sea could increase by 21–44 million tonnes by 2050, a 36–74% increase compared to current yields. This represents 12–25% of the estimated increase in all meat needed to feed 9.8 billion people by 2050. Increases in all three sectors are likely, but are most pronounced for mariculture. Whether these production potentials are realized sustainably will depend on factors such as policy reforms, technological innovation and the extent of future shifts in demand.","tags":["Food from the sea","Fisheries","Mariculture","Seustainable supply curves","Fisheries management"],"title":"The future of food from the sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jon M.

Our goal is to empirically analyze the determinants of innovation in electricity storage and its role in fostering technological innovations in renewable and conventional electricity generation. Using a global firm-level data set of electricity patents from 1963 to 2011, we find that better electricity storage promotes innovation not only in renewable energy but also in conventional technologies. Specifically, our estimates show that an additional storage patent increases the probability to apply for patents in renewable energy and efficiency-improving fossil fuel technologies two years from now by 1.09% and 0.65%, respectively. This implies that improved electricity storage technologies can boost the energy efficiency of conventional, fossil fuel-fired power plants as well as increase the use of renewable electricity. Thus, the ability of electricity storage to curb carbon emissions depends on: the competitiveness of renewable energy against conventional electricity generation, and conventional power generation mix as storage increases fossil-fuel efficiency and reduces ramping costs.","tags":["Electricity storage","Innovation","Electricity","Directed technical change"],"title":"From fossil fuels to renewables: The role of electricity storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ujjayant Chakravorty","Marie-Hélène Hubert","Michel Moreaux","Linda Nøstbakken"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"2ac0ded863ff4ea5e20c17fd12ac5de4","permalink":"https://lnostbakken.github.io/publication/chakravorty-hubert-moreaux-nostbakken-sje2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chakravorty-hubert-moreaux-nostbakken-sje2017/","section":"publication","summary":"About 40 percent of US corn is now used to produce biofuels, which are used as substitutes for gasoline in transportation.

Within this framework, we analyze how the allocation of liability between fishing firms and crew affects quota violations and the ability to design a socially efficient fisheries policy. We show that without wage frictions, it does not matter who is held liable. However, under the commonly used share systems of remuneration, crew liability generally yields a more efficient outcome than firm liability.

Overextraction and overcapacity represent two of the main fisheries management challenges, and we aim to model and analyze the two jointly. In a stylized resource model, quota violating and complying firms invest in capital, buy quotas, and choose their harvest. We show that in the short run, more capacity increases illegal extraction, while a well-functioning quota market partially alleviates this effect. We also show how tougher enforcement yields a double benefit by directly improving compliance and indirectly reducing incentives to invest in capacity, which improves future compliance. Our analysis thus contributes to the literature on market-based management of renewable resources.","tags":[],"title":"Quota Enforcement and Capital Investment in Natural Resource Industries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aaron Hatcher","Linda Nøstbakken"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438387200,"objectID":"7d145d130e4e7d6040cdd374e1ac9231","permalink":"https://lnostbakken.github.io/publication/hatcher-nostbakken-ere2015/","publishdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hatcher-nostbakken-ere2015/","section":"publication","summary":"We model the exploitation of an international (shared stock) fishery which is managed using national quotas determined as agreed shares of an annual total allowable catch (TAC).

We examine the determination of the TAC which maximises the present value of the fishery, given the agreed quota shares and each country’s harvest and enforcement best-response functions. Inefficiency may derive not only from non-optimal TAC shares but also from the countries’ implicit preferences for compliance. We illustrate these findings with a set of numerical simulations.

Inequality aversion generally lifts the consumption path of the poor region, while the rich region must take a greater share of the climate burden. Furthermore, with inequality aversion, the optimal climate policy generally leads to higher investment in clean capital in the North and in dirty capital in the South, thereby allowing the South to pollute more and develop faster. The optimal policy may even require the poor region to increase emissions relative to the uncoordinated Business-as-Usual case.

However, in many industries there is concern about their basic effectiveness due to non-compliance. We develop an enforcement model of a quota-regulated resource and focus on a situation with significant non-compliance and exogenous constraints on fines and enforcement budget. We propose a new enforcement system based on self-reporting of excess extraction and explicit differentiation of inspection rates depending on compliance history. We use differentiated inspections to induce firms to self-report excess extraction. This system increases the effectiveness of the quota by allowing the regulator to implement a wider range of aggregate extraction targets than under traditional enforcement, while ensuring an efficient allocation of extraction. In addition, inspection costs can be reduced without reductions in welfare.","tags":[],"title":"Quota Enforcement in Resource Industries: Self Reporting and Differentiated Inspections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Linda Nøstbakken"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686088157,"objectID":"ef11baf8b427a641348395e1656edbb0","permalink":"https://lnostbakken.github.io/publication/nostbakken-formal-2013/","publishdate":"2023-06-06T21:49:17.170676Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nostbakken-formal-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"I study renewable resource use and compliance in a dynamic model with both informal and formal modes of enforcement. Agents obtain utility from both resource use and from behaving according to a norm of quota compliance. The users can exceed their quota at the risk of being detected and formally punished, but they also risk informal sanctions in the form of social disapproval and guilt. I find that when accounting for informal enforcement, there is an indirect effect of regulatory change in addition to the intended direct effect. When policy change, such as tougher enforcement, makes individuals more compliant, the norm of compliance is gradually strengthened, which in turn induces more compliant behavior. I study the implications of policy change on compliance level, quota prices, and the norm of compliance, and show how the properties of the punishment function have important implications for the outcome.","tags":[],"title":"Formal and informal quota enforcement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Itziar Lazkano","Linda Nøstbakken","Raúl Prellezo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686088156,"objectID":"e8fe5800731388e2cb8fb5677e30087e","permalink":"https://lnostbakken.github.io/publication/lazkano-past-2013/","publishdate":"2023-06-06T21:49:16.785723Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lazkano-past-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"We analyze the efficiency of the international management of the Bay of Biscay anchovy.

The management of the North Sea herring, after the moratorium was lifted in 1981, is evaluated. The results indicate that the management has been suboptimal.
